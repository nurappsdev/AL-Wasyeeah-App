  "ayat": "O you who believe! When death approaches one of you, call two just witnesses from among you, and if you are on a journey and death approaches you, call two witnesses from among yourselves. If you are in doubt, then wait for them after the prayer. Then they will swear by Allah, 'We will not take any price for him, even if he is a relative, and we will not conceal the testimony of Allah, for then we will be among the sinners'. Surah Al-Ma'idah: 106",
